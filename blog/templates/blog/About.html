    <h3 class="my-5"> About Page</h3>
    <p>
        Let’s start with Wonderful blogger. As you can see from the screen shot it starts out by talking about others, not himself.

How different and refreshing it is from the usual, “I am so and so and I am doing such and such”. The Blogger about page is all about you and what you will learn from his website. It isn’t until way down the page that he actually introduces who he is.

Most “experts” start their about pages talking about themselves. Here Clark gives reasons why his blog will help you. What this does is actually give his following credentials more weight because you are curious as to who is providing all this amazing value. Rather than talking about how good he is, he lets his examples talk for him.
